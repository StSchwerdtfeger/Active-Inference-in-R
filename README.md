 I am still new to all of this. Feedback or contributions always welcome.
 
 
# CONVERTED SO FAR:

- Pencil and Paper Example
- Prediction Error Example
- Message Passing Example
- EFE Precision Updating Example 

# Current struggle: 
 - [[SOLVED]]get plot running for Figure 3 and 1 of Example 2 in the script for message passing example. 
      - the function spm_cat could be translated into R in the future - or some equivalent code written for it...
